# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a dynamic webpage where users could filter through UFO sightings based on date, city, country, and shape. We used Java Script inserted into a HTML page using Bootstrop styling effects.

## Results
To use the webpage, we advise reading the beginning paragraphs to understand the purpose of the page more in depth.

Once the user is ready to start searching through sightings they can use one or all of the filters to find the sightings of UFOs they are interested in. One can even search the shape of UFO if desired.

## Summary
One drawback of this design of webpage is that users couldn't add their own data. I think that would be extremely helpful in keeping track of new sightings and also recommend that we add that if possible. Another suggestion is to possibly add another filter of color of UFO. I think it would be cool to see what other people expereince in that way as well.
